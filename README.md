# 4350-CLI
CLI for sailmapper (4350 Assignment)

To run:
`python3 CLI.py`

Feature: https://github.com/COMP-4350-Group-8/comp4350-project/issues/3

This implementation was super easy because of the distributed nature of the project. having any frontend interact via an api makes creating comminication between a new  front end and the backend simple. The project and the feature implemented uses only CRUD operations so there isn't much to leak. No code needed to be changed, the api fuctions and this CLI just had to be created to match it.
